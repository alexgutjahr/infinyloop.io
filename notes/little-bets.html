          Most people are surprised that someone who has reached Chris Rock's level of success still puts himself out there in this way,
          willing to fail night after night, but Rock deeply understands that ingenious ideas almost never spring into people's minds fully formed;
          they emerge through a rigorous experimental discovery process.

          Like Chris Rock, Bezos has accepted uncertainty; he knows that he cannot reliably predict which ideas for new markets will work and which won't.
          He's got to experiment.

          Experimental innovators must be persistent and willing to accept failure and setbacks as they work toward their goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the core of this experimental approach, little bets are concrete actions taken to discover, test, and develop ideas that are achievable and affordable.

          When much is known, procedural planning approaches work perfectly well. When much is unknown, they do not.

          These methods are decidedly not ways of just trying a lot of things to see what sticks, like throwing spaghetti against a wall.
          The most productive creative people and teams are rigorous, highly analytical, strategic, and pragmatic.
        </p>
        <p>
          A lot of our most successful ideas over the years came from the bottom up, by really understanding user needs.
