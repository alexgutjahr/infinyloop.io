          Most people are surprised that someone who has reached Chris Rock's level of success still puts himself out there in this way,
          willing to fail night after night, but Rock deeply understands that ingenious ideas almost never spring into people's minds fully formed;
          they emerge through a rigorous experimental discovery process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like Chris Rock, Bezos has accepted uncertainty; he knows that he cannot reliably predict which ideas for new markets will work and which won't.
          He's got to experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Experimental innovators must be persistent and willing to accept failure and setbacks as they work toward their goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the core of this experimental approach, little bets are concrete actions taken to discover, test, and develop ideas that are achievable and affordable.
        </p>
        <p>
          When much is known, procedural planning approaches work perfectly well. When much is unknown, they do not.
        </p>
        <p>
          These methods are decidedly not ways of just trying a lot of things to see what sticks, like throwing spaghetti against a wall.
          The most productive creative people and teams are rigorous, highly analytical, strategic, and pragmatic.
        </p>
        <p>
          A lot of our most successful ideas over the years came from the bottom up, by really understanding user needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The "illusion of rationality": We are all vulnerable to this illusion. It happens when ideas or assumptions seem logical in a plan,
          spreadsheet model, PowerPoint, or memo, yet they haven't been validated on the ground or in the real world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seasoned entrepreneurs, she emphasizes, will tend to determine in advance what they are willing to lose, rather than calculating expected gains.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course the subject of affordable losses highlights a key issue with the little bets approach - it inevitably involves failure.
          In almost any attempt to create, failure, and often a good deal of it, is to be expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          By expecting to get things right at the start, we block ourselves psychologically and choke off a host of opportunities to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fixed mind-sets cause people to be overconcerned with seeking validation, such as grades, titles, or social recognition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conversely, those favoring a growth mind-set believe that intelligence and abilities can be grown through effort,
          and tend to view failures or setbacks as opportunities for growth. They have a desire to constantly challenge and stretch themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can be very confident in a fixed mind-set, but every time you hit a setback, every time you have to struggle,
          every time other talented people come around, one has to guard against that threatening information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Findings suggest that people exhibiting fixed mind-sets tend to gravitate to activities that confirm their abilities,
          whereas those with growth mindsets tend to seek activities that expand their abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Students with fixed mind-sets want to appear capable, even if that means not learning in the process.
          Because setbacks and criticism threaten their self-image, they give up more easily and exhibit greater risk aversion.
        </p>
        <p>
          When students were valued for their intelligence, failures would be taken more personally, even as being disgraceful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Praising ability alone reduces persistence, while praising effort or the processes a person goes through to learn leads to growth mind-set behaviors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, just failing is not the key; the key is to be systematically learning from failures.
          To be closely monitoring what's working and what is going wrong and making good use of that information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Research has shown that not only does everyone actually have a mixture of both fixed and growth mindsets,
          but the growth mind-set orientation can be developed. Doing so requires being willing to challenge underlying beliefs about abilities and learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a person tends toward a fixed mind-set,
          they can catch themselves and reframe situations as opportunities to learn rather than viewing them as a potential for failure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Healthy perfectionism is internally driven in the sense that it's motivated by strong personal values for things like quality and excellence.
          Conversely, unhealthy perfectionism is externally driven.
        </p>
        <p>
          External concerns show up over perceived parental pressures, needing approval, a tendency to ruminate over past performances,
          or an intense worry about making mistakes.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the methods that can be most helpful in achieving this balance, in order to embrace the learning potential of failure, is prototyping.
          What the creation of low cost, rough prototypes makes possible is failing quickly in order to learn fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be wrong as fast as we can. Which basically means, we're gonna screw up, let's just admit that. Let's not be afraid of that. But let's do it as fast as we can so we can get to the answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          the beginning of any new idea, the possibilities can seem infinite, and that wide-open landscape of opportunity can become a prison of anxiety and self-doubt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creating an atmosphere that allows for playfulness and improvisation is one of the most effective ways to inspire the experimentation that leads to the best ideas and insights.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are more likely to experience flow when we do work that appeals to our intrinsic interests that's also aligned with our personal strengths.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the best ways to identify creative insights and develop ideas is to throw out the theory and experience things firsthand.
